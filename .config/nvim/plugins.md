# Plugins

## Project Specific Configuration

I would like to find a way to make global marks local to a project.

## Code Actions

Check out "RishabhRD/nvim-lsputils" and "jinzhongjia/LspUI.nvim"

## Auto-updating Docs View

"amrbashir/nvim-docs-view"

## Focus

"folke/twilight.nvim" <- code dimming. looks like I could get it to just dim without desaturating

## Debugging

Do I need debugging plugins?

Check out nvim dap view as an alternative to nvim dap ui.

## Quicklist Plugin

Options:

- "stevearc/quicker.nvim" <- currently in use
- "folke/trouble.nvim"

## GitHub

octo

## CSharp

Try out "Hoffs/omnisharp-extended-lsp.nvim" in depth.

## Text Manipulation

wurli/split.nvim - opposite of 'J'
